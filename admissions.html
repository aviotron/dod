                                    Candidate should have a valid score for the Undergraduate Common Entrance
                                    Examination for

                                    more information about UCEED here.
                                </p>

                        <h5>Seat Allotment algorithm & Admission Process</h5>
                        <p>Since there is a single merit list the seat allotment algorithm is simple. In round 1, the
                            seats are
                            provisionally allotted to the candidates based on their choices, the seat available as per
                            the seat
                            matrix and their UCEED ranks. Digital copies of Certificates are verified and if found in
                            order, a
                            candidate gets the seat allotment letter, with a provision to either freeze or float. The
                            candidates
                            accept the seats provisionally allotted by paying 60000 through common online payment
                            portal.</p>
                        <p>
                            A candidate getting his first choice has it frozen - there is no further possibility of
                            upgradation.
                            Candidates not getting their first choice can exercise either of the two. They pay Rs. 60000
                            (a part
                            of their semester fees) through common online payment portal. A candidate can withdraw from
                            the
                            process prior to the third round (i.e., latest after the completion of the second round) and
                            the
                            tuition fees will be refunded in part (50% refund of the part of the semester fees paid,
                            i.e., Rs.
                            30000 will be refunded). Withdrawal any later than that will mean NO refund of the part of
                            the fees
                            paid. Withdrawal after the first round may lead to FULL refund of the part of the semester
                            fees
                            paid, depending on the decision of the UCEED committee.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If there are no vacancies at the end of the first round there will be NO second round.
                            However, if a
                            vacancy is created due to a candidate vacating a seat (due to say, getting admission to IITs
                            or
                            CFTIs which they might prefer), extra rounds of seat allotment will be conducted. Those
                            opting for
                            the float option will automatically be upgraded to a higher choice as per the list of
                            choices.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once the candidate has got the best possible choice at the end of the admission process (as
                            per
                            third admission list on July 11), he will have to report to the Institute allotted, for
                            admission
                            processes as per the rules of that institute. A list of candidates admitted to each
                            institute will
                            be prepared and sent. The amount of Rs. 60000 will be transferred to that Institute where
                            the
                            candidate has joined. The candidate has therefore to pay the remaining part of the fees to
                            the
                            Institute upon joining. Students admitted to the B.Des programme will not be eligible for
                            branch
                            change to any other undergraduate programmes offered by IIT Guwahati at any time during the
                            entire
                            duration of the programme.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <h5>Document verification & Registration</h5>
                        <p>

                            Students accepted the admission to IITG after payment of Rs. 60,000/- will report at IIT
                            Guwahati.
                            Candidates will be informed in the admission letter about the details of schedule and list
                            of

                            Masters in Design (M.Des) is one of the unique program offered by Department of Design
                            (DoD), IIT Guwahati. Student applying for post graduate (M.Des) program should qualify the
                            Common Entrance Examination for Design (CEED) conducted by IITs as a part of their central
                            admission procedure. They are further shortlisted through apptitude test and further on

                        <h4>Examination</h4>
                        <p>
                            The CEED examination will be conducted in two parts — Part A and Part B. All candidates must
                            answer both the parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Part A is a computer-based screening test. It evaluates visualization and spatial ability,
                            environmental and social awareness, analytical and logical reasoning, language and
                            creativity, observation and design sensitivity. Part A contains objective type questions —
                            numerical answer type questions (NAT), multiple select questions (MSQ) and multiple choice
                            questions (MCQ). Candidates who are shortlisted in Part A using the method mentioned in the
                            brochure will qualify for the evaluation of Part B.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Part B evaluates drawing, creativity, communication skills, and analytical and problem
                            solving skills. Part B scores will be calculated using the method mentioned in the brochure.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The final CEED score will be calculated by giving 25% weightage to marks obtained in Part A
                            marks and 75% weightage to scores obtained in Part B.
                        </p>

                        <h4>PhD Program Details</h4>
                        <p>
                            In its quest for syncretism, the Ph.D program will emphasize investigative work in
                            fundamental Design which is not only interdisciplinary but also intradisciplinary. The range
                            of disciplines of integrative interest include, but are not necessarily limited to,
                            Usability Engineering, Interaction Design, Design Semantics, Experiential Design,
                            Environment Design, Human –Computer Interaction Design, Ergonomics, Design Management and
                            Product Design Engineering. Since the program is rooted in User Centered Design, specific
                            areas in pure engineering design such as Machine Design, Software Design, VLSI design, etc
                            are not the focus of research. However all 'Use' and User connected design issues in pure
                            engineering areas, regardless of the branch, fall within the ambit of the research program.
                        </p>
